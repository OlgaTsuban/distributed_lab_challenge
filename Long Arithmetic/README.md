# Long Arithmetic

## Introduction
<p>
This code provides a custom BigInt class built upon Java's BigInteger class, empowering you to perform arithmetic operations on numbers exceeding the limitations of standard integer types.
</p>

## Key Features
- **Effortless Construction:**
Create BigInts from various sources: integers (long), strings, or existing BigInteger objects.
- **Comprehensive Arithmetic:**
Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%), and exponentiation (**) with ease.
- **Intuitive Comparisons:**
Utilize comparison operators (<, <=, >, >=, ==) to determine the relative order of BigInts.
- **Seamless Conversion:**
Convert between BigInts, strings, and integers (int) for maximum flexibility.

## Usage
To use the program, simply run it .
To compile the program : <code>javac BigInt.java</code>
After running the command you should see the .class file
To run the program : <code>java BigInt</code
